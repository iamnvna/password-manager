### Project Eleven - 100DaysOfCode
# Password Manager
This is a simple program collects user inputs, an account name and password, encrypts the password and stores it in a text file. 

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate library(s).
3. Define a function to create a key and write it in a .key file for encrypting and decrypting. Note: The key generating function has to run only once to prevent creating new keys anytime the program starts.
4. Define a function to load the .key file when the program starts.
5. Define a function that collects user input and writes them to a file.
6. Define a function to read the user inputs from the file in step 5.
7. Using if statement, accept user input to determine whether a user wants to add, view or q the program
8. Evaluate the user input and call the appropriate function.
9. Print output where necessary.
10. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program was my first introduction to the cryptography python library and it usecase.
* This program put my knowledge on writing to files and opening files to the test. I've gained understanding to opening files, both as strings and as bytecodes.
* I explored more the use of functions in this program and have become more conversant in writing and calling them.
